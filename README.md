## Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements help you change the normal flow of loop. They help you:
-	Break the loop
-	Exit the certain iteration of loop
-	Add placeholder

### 1.Break Statement
Break statement stops the loop completely, even if the condition is still True.
### 2. Continue statement
Continue statement skips the current iteration and move to the next one.
### 3. Pass statement
Pass statement does nothing. It’s used when a statement is syntactically required but you don’t want any action.
